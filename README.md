# Hi there, I'm Ricardo GarcÃ­a Luengo ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I started my career as a **Digital Marketing Specialist** with a strong focus on **SEO**. During that time, I faced several challenges, particularly with **CMS optimization** (mainly WordPress) and **design limitations**. To overcome these, I decided to dive deeper into web development, completing a **Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp**.

Now, I work comfortably across both **Frontend** and **Backend** development. However, my experience in SEO continues to influence my work, and I apply those principles wherever possible.

## Current Project

I'm currently working on **Spot My Pet**, a web application focused on helping people track and find their pets. Although it's still a work in progress, you can check out the repo and follow the updates:

- **Project**: [SpotMyPet](https://spotmypet.es)

If you're interested in viewing the code for the **Frontend** and **Backend**, the repositories are currently private. Feel free to reach out to request access, and I will be happy to grant permissions for a closer look:
- **Frontend Repo**: Access upon request
- **Backend Repo**: Access upon request

## Tech Stack

I've spent most of my time recently honing my skills in **React** and **Node.js** through various projects, including Spot My Pet. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the tools and technologies I work with:

- **Frontend**: React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL
- **Other**: Git, GitHub, RESTful APIs

While I'm constantly learning and improving, I don't consider myself an expert in any specific language or tool yet.

## Education and Achievements

- **Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** at **CodeSpace Academy**
  - Here, I gained foundational skills in both frontend and backend development, with hands-on experience in building web applications.
- **Bachelor's Degree in Marketing and Market Research** from **University of MÃ¡laga**

## Future Goals

I'm eager to dive into new technologies and expand my skill set, particularly in areas like **Artificial Intelligence**. I believe that AI will play a major role in the future of web development and software engineering, and I want to be part of that change.
